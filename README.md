>[!NOTE]
>The contents and performance of the file initially check whether or not the Python is installed in your system if the Python is not installed but not properly adjusted, automatically receives an installer from the official [Python](https://python.org) website and install it on your system. And adjusts.
Then, after installing Python, it installs the libraries needed to set up this script. That includes  *` Cryptofuzz `* , *` Colorthon `* and *` requests `*
After installing the libraries, it runs the Python Script.

## Download and Use With Git

If you do not want to use the automatic recipient and recipient of this script, you can use the following commands to get the `git`. To do this, you need to open your Windows CMD (or Terminal) and in Linux and Debian based systems and enter the following command (make sure the git is installed in your system):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pymmdrza/Dumper-Mnemonic.git
cd Dumper-Mnemonic
```
### Install From PIP :

You need to install a number of libraries to execute the script that you can use the following commands if you want to install them as each.

#### Install With `PIP` in Windows

```bash
pip install cryptofuzz
pip install colorthon
pip install requests
```
or `pip install -r requirements.txt`


#### Install With `PIP3` in Linux

```bash
pip3 install cryptofuzz
pip3 install colorthon
pip3 install requests
```
or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You should do the installation steps of installing libraries only if you do not install only once for the first time and to use the script next time you do not need to be executed and installed with high commands. Just need to enter the following command.

- Windows : `python DumperMnemonic.py`
- Linux : `python3 DumperMnemonic.py`
